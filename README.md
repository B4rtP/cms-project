# cms-project

- this project is not even close completed, production use is not recommended because of lack of security.

- Document Root for local server is cms-project/public (if you are using xampp: <path to your xampp folder> -> apache -> conf -> extra -> httpd-vhosts.conf)
- Database dump - routes table is necessary for router to work
