- this project is not even close completed, production use is not recommended.

- Document Root for local server is cms-project/public (if you are using xampp: [path to your xampp folder] -> apache -> conf -> extra -> httpd-vhosts.conf) and also add new host name and IP address to the windows hosts file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc folder)
- Database dump - routes table is necessary for router to work
